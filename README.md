# Tone Maker

Uses [ToneJS](https://tonejs.github.io/) to mock the tones from the [Tone32 ESP32 Library](https://github.com/lbernstone/Tone32). The web app keeps a recording of the clicked tones and gives you an option to generate code that can be used in a project. The format used can be found here https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs/tree/master

## Getting Started

1. Navigate into the project and install all the dependencies
   `cd tone-maker/ && npm install`

2. Once installed, run the development server:
   `npm run dev`
